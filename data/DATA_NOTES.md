# DATA_NOTES

## Dataset
operational_workflow_data.csv

## How the data was created/obtained
This dataset was simulated based on a practicum-approved organizational issue at D & E Networks LLC: enhancing client engagement and communication strategy for small to mid-sized healthcare organizations. The dataset reflects de-identified client engagement workflows (e.g., emails, calls, demos, executive briefs) over an approximately 3-month period and is intended for academic/portfolio use.

## What the dataset represents
Each row represents a single client engagement interaction (communication touchpoint) over an approximately 3-month period.

## De-identification / simulation notes
- This dataset contains no protected health information (PHI) and no client-identifying business information.
- No client organization names, personal names, emails, phone numbers, contract values, or other direct identifiers are included. Client records are labeled using generic IDs (e.g., C001).
- Data is used strictly for coursework and portfolio demonstration.

## Intended use in this project
The dataset will be used to identify patterns in client engagement and communication (e.g., channel effectiveness, topic complexity, executive-friendly messaging, ROI framing, trust/engagement outcomes) and to generate leadership-focused improvement ideas to strengthen client relationships and decision-making.
