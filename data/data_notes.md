# DATA_NOTES

## Dataset
operational_workflow_data.csv

## How the data was created/obtained
This dataset was provided as the alternate dataset for the Weeks 3–5 GitHub project.
It represents a de-identified or simulated operational workflow dataset for academic use.

## What the dataset represents
Each row represents a single client interaction/visit over an approximately 3-month period.

## De-identification / simulation notes
- This dataset contains no protected health information (PHI).
- No patient names, MRNs, addresses, full DOBs, or other direct identifiers are included.
- Data is used strictly for coursework and portfolio demonstration.

## Intended use in this project
The dataset will be used to explore workflow patterns (e.g., attendance/no-shows, service lines,
communication channels, and wait/service times) and generate leadership-focused improvement ideas.
