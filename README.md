# Health Informatics Leadership Impact Dashboard with AI Insights

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the MSHI Leadership Practicum. It demonstrates how health informatics leaders can use data and AI tools to identify workflow challenges, support decision-making, and propose realistic improvement strategies.

## Practicum Context
This project is based on a simulated/de-identified operational dataset modeled after a healthcare organization similar to MSM Community Care Network (MSM-CCN). No protected health information (PHI) is included.

## Leadership Question
How can operational data be used to identify workflow or communication bottlenecks that impact patient engagement, efficiency, and satisfaction?

## Data Description
- Time period: Last 3 months  
- Data type: Operational workflow and appointment data  
- Format: CSV  
- Rows: Approximately 100–300 simulated client interactions  

## Tools & Technologies
- GitHub
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) / Excel
- AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for leadership insights

## Project Status
🚧 In progress — data analysis and leadership impact report will be added in subsequent weeks.
